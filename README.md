      After downloading the source code, the run-time procedures out some wrong, because some places do not support python3 code, there are also a problem with the file code. They have been fixed.
      To tell the truth, now the function is still too little, but the corresponding, the code is also very simple, can be used as practice hand, just started learning python, just can now learn to use.
Free to add some features:
- Multithreading(to speed up)
